This week was a little different: No theory! Instead, an intense week working within an agile team.  Previously having mostly worked in pairs using pair-programming techniques, we tackled an assignment where we needed to work in a small group, self managing ourselves and delivering against the specs.  We were tasked to develop a booking website, sort of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Air BnB</a>

At the beginning we were a bit intimidated about how to tackle such task from scratch, and how were about to organise ourselves.  But that was just the first few minutes.  After that we really all work as a team and pull our wait to generate a great result.

Our code is available at <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/air_bnb" target="_blank">repo</a>.

And we deployed the app in Heroku, <a href="https://air-bnb-aams.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">available here</a>

It was a great opportunity to practice all the skills using Sinatra, but mixing it up with JavaScript and many other technologies, simulating a working environment.  Ah and the README.md is probably one of the most hilarious in GitHub, (take a peek) <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/air_bnb/blob/master/README.md#comment" target="_blank">here</a>
