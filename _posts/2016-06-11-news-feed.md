Week 8 was another week to further dive in JavaScript.  Concepts such as asynchronous running or promises where covered, together with further exposure to call back functions.  Also there was work with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) structures.  The challege was to interact with the Guardian newspaper API and display the headlines on a single page.  Clicking on the headline should send us to another page with the summary article.

These are the **skills** that I acquired after this week:

  - **API integration:** Practice the interaction with a third party API, sending requests to it and receiving data to be summarised by Alyen API and presented accordingly.

  - **Practice on the fronten JavaScript**

  - <u>Stub test requests to APIs</u>: To avoid service disturbance to the third party API
