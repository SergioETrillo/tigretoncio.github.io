The first weekend challenge of my Ronin course at Makers Academy served to consolidate the previous 4 weeks of Pre-Course and the first week of the course.

In particular, it tested the following concepts:

  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">_Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)_
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">_Test-Driven Development (TDD)_
  - <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">_Continuous Integration_
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank">_Single responsibility Principle (SRP)_

And the following technologies:

  - <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">_Ruby_
  - <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">_Git_ </a>_and_ <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio" target="_blank">_GitHub_
  - <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">_RSpec_
  - <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">_Travis CI_


The weekend challenge required to control flow of planes in an Airport, depending on a number of variables such as weather.  The instructions and my code are <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/airport_challenge" target="_blank">available here</a>.

At this week the hard work done in the PreCourse working with bash and Ruby was starting to pay as it was easy to pick up fundamental concepts such as the presented above. **Great way to start!**
