The first weekend challenge of my Ronin course at Makers Academy was intended to test several topics seen during the 4 weeks of PreCourse and the first week of course. 

The main topics were:

  - Command line
  - Ruby
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Git and GitHub
  - RSpec
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)


The goal of the first weeks' workshops was understanding the benefits of TDD while building a simple application that controls the flow of planes at an airport. You can see my work <a href="https://github.com/omajul85/airport_challenge" target="_blank">here</a>. 

These are the **skills** that I acquired after this week:

  - **Better pair-programming:** Instead of focussing only on progress and results, I changed my approach to concentrate on the learning objectives of the group. The first sessions were very exhausting because I tried to work as if I was alone. Each pair partner is a completely different world, and the rhythm and difficulty of each session must be adapted according to our strengths and weaknesses.
  
  - **Ruby:** Putting in practise some **SOLID** principles in my code, such as the *Single Responsability Principle*. The code I have done is **flexible**, which means that it is easy to change because each class is not dependent on other classes. I learnt the idea behind *Dependency Injection*, a software design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies. 
  
  - **RSpec:** In just one week I have used a huge amount of RSpec matchers to test my applications. I feel more comfortable with my tests and the syntax.

  - **External tools:** In addition to all the the topics listed above, I used *Travis CI*, *Hound* and *Coveralls* during the development cycle of this application. These tools will be used during the full course and I found them very useful to check if my code fulfills the business requirements in terms of test coverage and style.
