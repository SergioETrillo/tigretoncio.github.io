For the final project, I decided to participate in developing a mobile app that we called _Phlash_. The application authenticates the user, and activates the camera where they can take pictures that are automatically shared with followers.  Followers get notifications of new messages coming, and once the picture is displayed it shows for 2 seconds, then it is erased, (Snapchat style).

## Technology Stack

- Swift 2.2
- XCode 7.3.1
- Parse as backend server
- CloudCore to secure user data and data exchanges



## Fun facts about this project:

* The project was developed in 11 days by a team of 4 people
* It was developed using Swift and XCode.
* Many user stories were generated by the team and managed using <a href="https://waffle.io/" target="_blank">Waffle</a>.  _"Only"_ 35 were implemented
* 0 members of the team knew about Swift before starting the project
* 1 member of the team had not been used a modern Mac before this project.  That member was me.


The code is available in this  <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/phlash" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.
