Third week has introduced coding for the Web, with basic concepts such as client server relationships, the HTTP protocol, or GET and POST requests.  I knew all this from my previous education and experience, but it is great to look at it from a developer point of view.

The challenge was building the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The basic requirement involved to work against the computer.  My version includes also allows two human players, and also covers an extended version of the game using "Lizard and Spock", famous to appear in the American sitcom _The Big Band Theory_. Please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> for more details about the game.

The goals of the challenge were understanding the client-server communication via requests **GET** and **POST**, the usage of HTML forms, test-driven the development of the application using Capybara feature tests, and learn how to create a simple website with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra.

>I learnt how a Sinatra project applies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC</a> structure in order to follow the idea of separation of concerns and organise the code in different layers.

My code is available at this <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/rps-challenge" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.

These are the **skills** that I acquired after this week:

  - <u>Build simple applications in Sinatra</u>: This framework was a good starting point to understand the separation of concerns using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC</a>

  - <u>HTML and CSS</u>: I have started to refresh some concepts of HTML and CSS for this challenge

  - <u>Practic Ruby classes for Web apps</u> I have got the opportunity of practising OOP concepts in this challenge, modelling classes appropiate to the game
