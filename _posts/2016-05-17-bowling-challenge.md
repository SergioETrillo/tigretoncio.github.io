This week I started learning JavaScript, the de-facto language of the web. It was done Makers style, testing first, and so the course introduced Jasmine as the testing framework and also jQuery, a library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

> The weekend challenge was to implement the calculation of bowling game in JavaScriptcount and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player in JavaScript.

My code is available at <a href="https://github.com/tigretoncio/bowling-challenge" target="_blank">repo</a>.

These are the **skills** that I acquired after this week:

  - <u>JavaScript</u>: With Ruby knowledge under my belt, it was easier to tackle JavaScript, although the language was more verbose in Syntax and had some conceptual differences such as not having classes, (just objects), or the use of prototypes instead of constructors.  However I was pretty quickly in a position of writing useful code in JS.

  - <u>Jasmine Testing</u>: One of the test frameworks for JavaScript

  - <u>JQuery</u>: A nice library to simplify the behaviour of webpages, such as defining behaviour when clicking on buttons, etc.

  - <u>Google chrome DevTools</u>: DevTools help to test code on the JS cosole, inspect HTTP requests or get insight for code optimisation.
