This is simple a reminder of the basic commands you can use to copy and paste files and folders. You use `Ctrl + C` to copy, `Ctrl + V` to paste and `Ctrl + X` to cut. For more information, please visit [Marca][marca].


Command lines used to set Jekyll:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
